1. Udacity provided sample images of 960 x 540 pixels to train our pipeline

The pipeline itself will look as follows:
-Convert original image to HSL(HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness)
-Isolate yellow and white from HSL image
-Combine isolated HSL with original image
-Convert image to grayscale for easier manipulation
-Apply Gaussian Blur/Gaussian smoothing to smoothen edges
-Apply Canny Edge Detection on smoothed gray image
-Trace Region Of Interest and discard all other lines identified by our previous step that are outside this region
-Perform a Hough Transform to find lanes within our region of interest and trace them in red
-Separate left and right lanes
-Interpolate line gradients to create two smooth lines
