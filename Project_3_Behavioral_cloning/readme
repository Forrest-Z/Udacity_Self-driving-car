Based on the paper: "End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars"

-Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior.
-Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images.
-Train and validate the model with a training and validation set.
-Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road.
-Summarize the results with a written report.
