-Distortion Correction
  compute the camera matrix and distortion co-efficients to undistort the image

-Gradients and color thresholds
  apply thresholds on gradients and colors (in RGB and HLS color spaces) to obtain a binary thresholded image 
 
-Perspective transform ("birds-eye view")
  extract the vertices to perform a perspective transform
  
-Detect lane pixels (sliding window search)
  perform a sliding window search, starting with the base likely positions of the 2 lanes, calculated from the histogram. 
  using 10 windows of width 100 pixels.The x & y coordinates of non zeros pixels are found, a polynomial is fit for 
  these coordinates and the lane lines are drawn.
 
-searching around previosly detected lane line 
  Since consecutive frames are likely to have lane lines in roughly similar positions, we search around a margin of 50 pixels of the previously detected lane lines

-Inverse transform and output For the final image:
    Paint the lane area
    Perform an inverse perspective transform
    Combine the precessed image with the original image
